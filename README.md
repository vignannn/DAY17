First, the program takes the student’s Name, Registration Number, and Section using scanf() and stores them in character array. This helps personalize every output with student details. 
The user enters the total number of employees (max 10), and their salaries are stored in a 1d array. The array makes it easy to perform repeated operations on multiple salaries. For the menu, a do – while loop is used to continuously display the menu until the user selects Exit. Each menu option is handled using a switch – case statement for clarity. The total and average salaries are calculated by summing all the elements of the array and dividing by the total number. The highest and lowest salaries use a loop that compares each value. And the program counts how many salaries are greater or lesser than the average using conditional checks. By using bubble sort algorithm, the salaries are rearranged in ascending order by comparing and swapping adjacent elements. After every menu operation, the program prints the student’s details and also prints the challenge info to make it unique to the user.
